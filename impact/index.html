>>>>>>> origin/master

I was privileged to be a beneficiary of this scheme while on campus, and it broadened my horizon in ways I least expected at the time. Through the program, I was able to learn and master econometrics with the guidance of the founder of SOWN, Prof. Chinwe Okoyeuzu, and my project supervisor, Dr. Kalu. This skill enabled me to successfully conduct the analysis for my undergraduate project and also assist my classmates in solving analytical challenges in theirs.

The knowledge I acquired also proved valuable when my team and I worked on our first academic paper earlier this year. Although the paper is yet to be published, I served as the Analyst, and the results were outstanding.

Beyond technical skills, the program gave me the opportunity to meet remarkable professionals who trained us in areas such as LinkedIn Optimization, Business Analysis, Project Management, Microsoft Excel, and more.

As I mentioned earlier, SOWN is more than a human capital development scheme—it is a platform that gives both the less privileged and the wealthy equal access to quality learning at no cost.

For anyone considering sponsoring this initiative, I strongly encourage you to do so. SOWN is a noble effort in the fight against youth unemployment caused by the lack of necessary skills.

Thank you."</p>

SOWN challenged me to think outside the box, to stop seeing my time as something to “just pass,” and instead invest it into building skills and values that last. It taught me that success is not only about what you know but also about how you can share it, release it, and create impact in others. That’s something that goes beyond academics-t’s about leadership, service, and growth.
One of the most valuable skills I personally developed is communication. I learned how to express ideas clearly, connect with people, and create influence. And in today’s world, that’s a skill that can open doors in almost any space-whether you’re presenting in class, sitting in an interview, or building a business.
If there’s one thing I’d say to anyone, it’s this: don’t limit yourself. Use every opportunity SOWN offers, not just to learn, but to build yourself into someone who can stand out, adapt, and thrive anywhere"</p>
